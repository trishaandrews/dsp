# Learn Statistics

Read Allen Downey's [Think Stats (second edition)](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/) and [Think Bayes](http://greenteapress.com/thinkbayes/) for getting up to speed with core ideas in statistics and how to approach them programmatically. Both books are completely available online, or you can buy physical copies if you would like.

Some people enjoy video content such as Khan Academy's [Probability and Statistics](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability) or the much longer and more in-depth Harvard [Statistics 110](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2SOU6wwxB0uwwH80KTQ6ht66KWxbzTIo). You might also be interested in the book [Statistics Done Wrong](http://www.statisticsdonewrong.com/) or a very short [overview](http://schoolofdata.org/handbook/courses/the-math-you-need-to-start/) from School of Data.


Complete the following exercises. They come from Think Stats, and some can be solved using code provided with the book. The preface of Think Stats [explains](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2001.html#toc2) how to use the code.

Communicate the problem, how you solved it, and the solution, within each of the following [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) files. (You can include code blocks and images within markdown.)

2. [Think Stats Chapter 3 Exercise 1](statistics/3-1-actual_biased.md) (actual vs. biased)
3. [Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](statistics/4-2-random_dist.md) (a random distribution)

How do frequentist and Bayesian statistics compare?

>Frequentist statistics focuses on the probability of the data, given the hypothesis. It treats data as a repeatable random sample, and the parameters or hypotheses as fixed. This means that the data might be slightly different in a subsequent study, while the parameters remain constant, and the hypotheses are fixed at either true or false, but unknown. Frequentist statistics do not utilize information prior to the current study. The frequentist name comes from the fact that a frequentist view of statistics is concerned with the frequency with which one observes data.

>Bayesian statistics focuses on the probability of the hypothesis, given the data. It treats the data as fixed and the hypothesis as random. In other words, the data is limited to what is observed from the realized sample and the studies are fixed, while the parameters and hypotheses are unknown and have some probability between 0 and 1 of being true or false. Bayesian statistics readily use inferences from prior studies. The name is due to the fact that Bayes' Theorem is necessary to calculate P(Hypothesis | Data).
